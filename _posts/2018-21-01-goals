title: Goals as a Web Developer
---

When I was first accepted into Bloc I had one goal as a web developer - to make $$$
(at least more than I'm currently making). When someone would ask me where or
what industry I wanted to work in, I always replied banking. Why not? I live in
a big city and banking is a huge industry here. I don't know anything banking
but I've heard they make great money, sounds like the job for me. Recently,
I've realized that I have a skill set that not every web developer has - I have
inside knowledge of how MDS works in long term care. I know what functionaility
makes our lives easier and when I become a more skilled developer I will have
the capcity to write/design a program that is functional! Of course, this
isn't the first time anyone has done this but from the software that I've worked
with in my current job, I know that developers are not familiar with our job
and how we need it to function. I can bridge this gap, I never realized that I
would be able to do something so big. I know this is a lofty goal and will take
years to gain that skill but it's something I've look forward too. My short term
goals are much easier though. I would like to find a new job as a web developer
with a company that likes to work with new developers. I'm not really sure what
industry this will be in but I'm open to anything. I'm so excited to start a new
career that all I want is someone to give me a chance. Coding is so fun, it's
frustrating at times but the challenge is welcomed. When I finally made the leap
to change careers I wanted something that was new every day. I strive in that
enviroment and I'm excited to see where I can go.
