title: Code is Challenging
---

In mid August when I started I was completely unprepared for the road that lied
ahead. I had looked into coding, mostly HTML which for the most part seemed easy.
The first or two I was submitting checkpoint like hot cakes, I thought I'd be done
in no time. Then we started the command line, uh oh, I was stuck for a day ...
or two. I made it through though and now use it like a boss, sorta. Next up was
JavaScript, the thorn in my side. I have struggled with JavaScript since the first
checkpoint. My brain doesn't always compute JavaScript they way I'd like but you
have to begin retraining yourself in how you think. I'd like to say that the
struggle is over, but it isn't. JavaScript
is hard, it's a new language and new way of thinking. It's so hard to be a adult
learner because we expect ourselves to understand things in a short period of time.
I failed my first assessment, a lot of it having to do with my lack of JavaScript
knowledge. I've learned that failure is common with learning to code and not to back
down just because you failed. It's now January, 4 months later, JavaScript is
still hard but I can explain the code to someone new and it still make sense.
Which to me is a achievement, I still struggle writing the actual code part but
I'll learn over time. The interesting thing about being a web developer is that
things change all the time and people, experienced or not, still get hung up on
certain concepts. Google is your friend! You find a world of people who have
struggled with the same thing and it helps you feel not as alone.
