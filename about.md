Hi, I'm Brittany!
Where to begin? I've been a foodservice professional for 8 years. In my 8 years I've worked for non profit and for profit long term care facilities in North Carolina and Tennessee. I've been a lot of places and done of a lot of things with my current company. I've been a district manager who has overseen 11 buildings and over 100 employees to running one kitchen and managing 12 employees. Currently I work with three buildings taking care of nutritional needs and MDS (which is how LTC facilities get $$$). I love my job but have longed for something different and more challenging. I've wanted to learn coding for about two years now. I looked at a lot of places off and on but could never find a boot camp that suited me. In March, after a long debate I decided to apply for a boot camp not far from house that fit my life. Well, needless to say it didn't work out which left me heart broken. Finally in July after months of being unsatisfied with my current career, I took a career test. I knew that coding wasn't for me since I hadn't been accepted into the previous boot camp. After several test I kept getting the same result -- WEB DEVELOPER. This was it, this was going to be my career path no matter what anybody told me. I started to look around for other places and found Bloc. After a week of applying I was accepted and even got a scholarship. I was elated. It's been a journey to get here and I know it will be a journey to the finish but I'm so glad to be here.
